		<h2>
		Education
		</h2>
		In Secondary school I studied Math and Economics. 
		When I was 18 years old I was advised not to go to University.
		It would be out of my league. 
		I studied for High School Teacher in Biology and Sport. 
		As a student in Leuven I realized that maybe University wasn’t out of my league at all, 
		so I started my education for Master in Biology (option Plant Physiology) 
		and did my thesis in the Laboratory for Molecular Celbiology. 
		I obtained my master degree in 2007.
		I’ve started evening courses. 
		I’m looking for a job in which I can use my education and professional experience in science 
		and combine it with my aspirations in Informatics.
