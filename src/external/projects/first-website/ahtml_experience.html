		Experience
		</h2>
		Then I went to Australia for 9 months. 
		After my studies I had an urge for a well deserved adventure. 
		I also travelled through France for 2 months. 
		When I came back I started working as a teaching assistant in the Faculty of Economics at the K.U. Leuven 
		for the course ‘Ontwikkeling van Bedrijfstoepassingen, 
		a course for improving the analytical skills of students. 
		This course ran for 1 semester every year, 
		so the rest of the year I was mostly supporting the staff members of education in their administrative work. 
		It was a job that one could do for a maximum of 5 years, and since I didn’t see an interesting future for me over there, not any perspectives, 
		and I couldn’t grow anymore, I decided to quit. 
		I moved to Brussels and worked a year as a call agent, 
		but more importantly I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want to do career wise in the future.
