						Currently, many potential donor organs are considered too high-risk for organ transplantation as we have difficulty predicting whether higher-risk organs will function well after transplantation. Unfortunately, we end up discarding many organs that would function well after transplantation. TransCent performs research to optimise the use of higher-risk organs by improving prediction tools, protecting organs from injury and improving their function after transplantation. This way, the number of transplantable organs can be increased and more patients on the waiting list can be helped.

						All donor organs are second hand. Unfortunately they do not go on forever. ​
						By investigating the progression of longterm pathologies in the post-transplant organ and understanding the mechanisms behind the declining function, we aim to prolong the life span of the organ and its recipient. Morever, this way, we reduce the need for a re-transplantation, making more organs available for transplantation.
