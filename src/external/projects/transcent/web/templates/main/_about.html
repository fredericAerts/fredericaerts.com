	<p class="divider--ellipsis">...</p>
	<p class="main__paragraph">
		In 2013, 10.644 patients were transplanted with one or more organs in the Eurotransplant region.​
​	</p>
	<p class="main__paragraph">
		Unfortunately, the sad reality is that the number of patients on the waiting list exceeds the number of organs available for transplantation. Because of a shortage of good quality donor organs, many patients die while waiting for an organ. ​
​	</p>
	<p class="main__paragraph">
		Transplantation-related research is necessary to increase the quality and number of donor organs, thereby improving the health and life of transplant recipients.​
​	</p>
	<p class="main__paragraph">
		The <strong class="underline">Leuven Transplant Center (TransCent)</strong> was founded as a platform to streamline transplantation-related research at the KU Leuven. ​We are a dynamic team of researchers and clinicians from different medical and scientific backgrounds with a passion  about organ transplantation and improving the lives of our patients.
